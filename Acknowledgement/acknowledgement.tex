\begin{acknowledgements}      

I'd like to acknowledge the mentorship and guidance provided by Shravan throughout my last two years as well as in this project. If not for him, I perhaps would not have immersed myself in and and missed out on this wonderful subject. I also acknowledge the tireless work and unending enthusiasm of my collaborator, Srijan Bharati Das from Princeton to bring this work to fruition. I also acknowledge many a fruitful discussions we've had with Samarth G K and Dr H M Antia, for getting a handle on solar differential rotation. Finally, I want to thank Sunil Jaiswal, Pranav S, and Samarth GK who proofread the manuscript and significantly uplifted its quality through their invaluable suggestions.
