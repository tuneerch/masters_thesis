This work aims at solving the helioseismic forward problem of finding frequency splittings in of degenerate solar p-modes due to steady global magnetic fields. A integral form of frequency splittings in term of Lorentz stress ($\Bv\Bv$) and corresponding sensitivity kernels is proposed. Analytic forms of these kernels are evaluated. A synthetic magnetic field is constructed to validate the sensitivity kernels. It is found that a predominantly toroidal magnetic field of peaking ar $10^5 G$ existing at the tachocline and a dipolar magnetic field ranging from tachocline to surface at $10G$ introduces a mean shift of about $5nHz$ and an $a_2$ of about $60pHz$ int the splitting profile. These changes in the acoustic frequency spectrum are not detectable by current level of observational precision in helioseismic data.
